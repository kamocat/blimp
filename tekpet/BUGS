This file is for recording the bugs.
As you find a fix for them, it's not neccesary to delete the old comments,
and is often more useful to instead explain what you did to fix it.

Servo control works on special pins 0 - 2, using Timer1.
(Include "rc_servo.h" to use the functions)
To be perfectly honest, I don't know why it is working the way it does.
If you have the time to test it, feel free to fix it so it makes more sense.



DC motor control works partially.
The timers are operational, although slower than expected.
The "run motors" function is untested, as are the direction and mode
features of the motor controller.
Also, the motor controller seems to shut off above 300mA, although it is
rated for 2.4A.
