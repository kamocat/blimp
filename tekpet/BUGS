This file is for recording the bugs.
As you find a fix for them, it's not neccesary to delete the old comments,
and is often more useful to instead explain what you did to fix it.

Servo control works on special pins 0 - 2, using Timer1.
(Include "rc_servo.h" to use the functions)
To be perfectly honest, I don't know why it is working the way it does.
If you have the time to test it, feel free to fix it so it makes more sense.


DC motors work, and have a define to scale them down from full voltage.
Be careful when you're reprogramming, though.  It stops the microcontroller
wherever it is, so sometimes the motor will get full voltage for a couple
seconds.  You can prevent this by powering the microcontroller soleley
by USB when you want to program it, and then switch on the main power
again when you are ready.
