This file is for recording the bugs.
As you find a fix for them, it's not neccesary to delete the old comments,
and is often more useful to instead explain what you did to fix it.

Servo control works on special pins 0 - 2, using Timer1.
(Include "rc_servo.h" to use the functions)
To be perfectly honest, I don't know why it is working the way it does.
If you have the time to test it, feel free to fix it so it makes more sense.



DC motor control works.
The timers are operational, although slower than expected.
Some issues that were fixed:
Motor 1 and 2 are mislabeled on the PCB silkscreen.  (Motor1 is labelled
Motor2, and vice versa).  So, I changed the code to match the silkscreen, 
rather than the schematic.
The motor controller operates between 8 and 30v.  So, it was having issues
with my 7.2v battery pack.
The "run motors" function is fixed so that it will take int8_t, and
correctly deal with the polarity.
