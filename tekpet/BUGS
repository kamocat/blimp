This file is for recording the bugs.
As you find a fix for them, it's not neccesary to delete the old comments,
and is often more useful to instead explain what you did to fix it.

Servo control works on special pins 0 - 2, using Timer1.
(Include "rc_servo.h" to use the functions)
To be perfectly honest, I don't know why it is working the way it does.
If you have the time to test it, feel free to fix it so it makes more sense.



Regular motor control is currently not yet implemented.


Communication is not fully tested.  The UART works, but the message handling
needs to be verified.  The receiving is done using interrupts, but a send
queue still needs to be implemented.

On the wunderboard stuff, I'm having significant issues not making columns
bleed together when it cycles through.  I don't know why this is an issue
now (though it hasn't been in the past).  To alleviate this and at least
make the columns readable, I have slowed it down as much as possible
(a little slower than 4hz).  It is also displaying amber, though it
should be displaying green.
