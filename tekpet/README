This is the repo for the tekpet.
Currently the scheme for communication is to send four bytes:

The first is the start byte (255).

The second is the speed of the left motor (uint8_t, centered at 127)
The third is the speed of the right motor (uint8_t, centered at 127)

The fourth is the increment of the servo (uint8_t).  This value is unique
because it does not directly set the position of the servo, it just sends
whether to increment, decrement, or stay the same:
2 - increment
1 - stay the same
0 - decrement
