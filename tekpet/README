This is the repo for the tekpet.
Currently the scheme for communication is to send four bytes:
The first is the start byte (-128).
The second is the speed of the left motor (int8_t)
The third is the speed of the right motor (int8_t)
The fourth is the increment of the servo (int8_t).

The reason the start bit is -128 is because this provides a symmetrical
command range, from -127 to 127, when using signed integers.  I've heard
255 is more common, but I think it's silly to leave a hole in the range at -1.
