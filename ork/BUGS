This file is for recording the bugs.
As you find a fix for them, it's not neccesary to delete the old comments,
and is often more useful to instead explain what you did to fix it.


UART needs to be changed to work on 16MHz.

Communication is adequately functional.  The UART receive works, including 
the message handling.  The receiving is done using interrupts, but a send 
queue still needs to be implemented.
WARNING: The start byte has changed from 0x80 to 0xFF.
The centers for the motor motor control have changed from 0 to 127.
The center for the servo bump has changed from 0 to 1.
This offest is taken care of by the receive, and should not affect the
functionality of the device.
