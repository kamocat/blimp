This is the repo for the ork (OSURC Robotics Kit).
It's actually no longer a blimp - instead, it's a robot.
However, the code is similar enough that we've decided to keep the same
repo.
ork (OSURC Robotics Kit).
It's actually no longer a blimp - instead, it's a robot.

Currently the scheme for communication is to send three bytes:

The first is the start byte (255).

The second is the speed of the left motor (uint8_t, centered at 127)
The third is the speed of the right motor (uint8_t, centered at 127)



It's important to note that the atmega32u4 is very similar to the at90usb686,
but different in a few ways:
timer/counter3 only has one PWM output.
(There are others, but I haven't looked into them yet)
